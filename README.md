# RSA
Small project implementing a RSA Algorithm in Java 10, along with several different prime-finding methods(Fermat's Factorization method and the sieve of eratosthenes) to decrypt messages. Performs reasonably quickly on 1024 bit encryption.

To run, load it in an IDE of your choice and run main.
